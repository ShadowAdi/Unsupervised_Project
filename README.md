# **Unsupervised Learning Project**

# Dataset - "It is Inside The Data Folder".

I Have Performed First EDA And Then  Feature Enginnering...Like Normalizing The Feature Values With Help of `Standard Scaler`. And Then Applying Dimensionality Reduction With The Help of `PCA` .
And Found Out That `DBSCAN` Is The Best Model And Found The `Silhoutte Score` For The `DBSCAN Model`.
